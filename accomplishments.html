                                        <p>We have designed a primitive prototype of the Intelligent Ground vehicle (IGV) having some basic features of the actual IGV which will be competing with other IGVs in the IGVC. Two development boars which are used in this prototype are Raspberry Pi 3 and Arduino Uno.Arduino microcontroller is used along with a motor driver shield for the DC Motors and Servo motors to control the drive mechanism parameters such as speed and stearing. This Arduino controller is in control of Raspberry Pi 3 using 12C communicatoion in Master-Slave configuration</p>

                                        <p>A custom Simuation has been developed with specific self-designed virtual environment. The training and testing of the algorithms is being on a virtual platform  called Unity-3D and will be implemented into hardware model. For getting an intelligent program to make the IGV capable of autonomous driving,concepts of Deep Learning will be used for implementing a neural network which will be the model responsible for self driving nature of the IGV. However, instead of training and testing of this model onto the actual vehicle, this phase will be carried on a simulation,which will behave as a virtual environment in which the vehicle is to be tested.</p>
